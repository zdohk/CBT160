)F Function -

    FREEALL is a command for freeing (unallocating) several unused
    files all at once.  This command should be executed from time to
    time during a TSO session to reduce session overhead.

    FREEALL will free all files except:
        1.  Those which are in use (for example, open datasets).
        2.  Those which are excepted from processing by the computer
            center (see the SYSMASKS operand).
        3.  Those which you designate not to be unallocated (see
            the EXCEPT operand, and the NOTEMP, NODUMMY, NOSYSOUT       TS05203
            and NOTERM operands).                                       TS05203

)O Operands -

))LIST -
    List the names and types of all files which are freed.  List        TS05203
    the dataset names associated with each file (for concaten-          TS05203
    ations:  list the first dataset name).  Default: NOLIST             TS05203
))NOLIST -
    Don't list the names of files which are freed.  Default:
    NOLIST

))CONCATS -
    Unallocate concatenations.  (Concatenations are groupings           TS05203
    of several datasets into a single logical file.)                    TS05203
    Default: CONCATS                                                    TS05203
))NOCONCATS -
    Don't unallocate concatenations.  Default: CONCATS

))DYNAM -
    Only free files which have been allocated during the current
    TSO session.  Do not free files which were allocated during
    initial LOGON processing, or with JCL when running TSO in
    batch.  Default: DYNAM
))ALL -
    Free files which have been allocated during the current TSO
    session, and also files which were allocated during initial
    LOGON processing, or with JCL when running TSO in batch.
    Default: DYNAM

))SYSMASKS -
    Show the list of file name (ddname) masks which are                 TS05203
    installation defined.  These file names will always be
    excepted from unallocation processing.

    Note:  When SYSMASKS is used, all other operands are ignored.
           Only a list will be produced.  No files will be freed.

))EXCEPT(mask1,mask2,...)
    This operand instructs FREEALL not to free files whose
    names match the masks in the parentheses.  See EXAMPLES,
    below.

    Temporary datasets (those which have system-assigned dataset        TS05203

))EXAMPLES:

    1.  FA

          Frees all files not in use which were dynamically
          allocated during the TSO session.

    2.  FA  L

          Same as example 1, but also lists the file names.

    3.  FA  L  EXCEPT(AUDITOUT,FT22F001)

          Frees and lists all files not in use which were
          dynamically allocated during the TSO session, except

          then followed by 'F001'.
